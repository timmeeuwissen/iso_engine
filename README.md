# iso_engine
I just wanted to understand what you have to think of in order to build an isometric perspective 
game when you do not have access to the 3D possibilities we have nowadays.

It works, but it's far from complete. 
Some of the things I have on my wishlist:
- jumping
- add orientation to the item that is moved, so you know which sprite to take
- collision detection
- collision detection for portions of a tile
- isolate / localise waters when they occur
- use the keys to manipulate, and then to download the map as a config

Please do not use this without my consent, but feel free to provide pull-requests on it.

Cheers,
Tim
